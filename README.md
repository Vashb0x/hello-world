# hello-world
This is my intro to github
My name is Andrew and I've been working on learning programming by myself. With this I am learning to use GitHub in order to put my work in a public space for others to view and use in the future, as well as for myself to refer back to when I need to. I mainly know Python right now but will be working on learning C# and C++ very soon in order to progress my knowledge.
